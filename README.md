# The influence of constituency and conditional probabilities on disfluencies in spontaneous speech of adults who stutter

Ksenia Gordeeva, University of Oregon, Linguistics Department

## Corpus 
- Shared by Dr. Nan Bernstein Ratner (UMD) and Dr. Kenneth St. Louis (WVU)
- Transcripts
- Spontaneous speech
  - Interviews of different length (â‰ˆ30 min. long)
  - Various topics related to interviewee life experience.
  - Diagnosed as AWS (adults who stutter)
  - Over 18 yo.
##Factors of Interest 
- Constituency effect 
  - Does constituency determine position of repetition disfluencies in adults?
  - Are repetition repairs in speech of AWS sensitive to constituency?
  - Does constituency determine position of other types of stuttering disfluencies (repetition vs. blocks vs. prolongation)?

- Probabilistic factors 
  - How probabilistic relations between words affect frequency of disfluencies, loci of disfluencies, length of  repetition disfluency (=length of repair)? Are they good predictors of repetition location and length?
    - Backwards transitional probability
    - Forward transitional probability
    - String frequency  
  - Does the influence of probabilistic factors on the frequency and loci of disfluencies differ according to type of disfluency (repetition vs. blockage vs. prolongation)?
  
 # Importance 
- More information on nature of stuttering across languages 
- Increased understanding of the relationship between language and stuttering help plan evaluation and treatment
- Increased understanding of ling. factors can help improve stuttering diagnosis
- Improvement of automatic speech recognition and understanding techniques
